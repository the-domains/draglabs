What can I look up for you Daniel?

This is what's involved...

Shyam's API sends a JSON file to Daniel, which contains start time's end times, file names, sample rates and more. Daniels program takes all that data and packages into time formats which are compatible the industries to music editing softwares. 

This needs to happen, it needs to happen yesterday, nobody goes home till it works. 

We have a mission, we are building this recording platform so that these guys can jam. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eac7e267-aa2a-4daa-86b4-3594cbe2cdef.png)
